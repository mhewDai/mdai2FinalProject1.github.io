French Weather and Energy Consumption

By: Matthew Dai

Abstract:

Energy consumption is on the rise due to increase in the reach of technology as well as the demand for a less cleaner lifestyle by many countries. As more people buy electric vehicles and smart devices become more prevalent, there will also be  an increase in energy demand and usage. It will be common for people to discuss new fuel sources to replace fossil fuels, but not many look at the weather. To better understand the relationship between weather and energy consumption, this paper looks at different measurements of weather, including temperature, dew point, and precipitation levels. This is compared to the energy consumption of France from 2017 measured in Megawatt per hour(MWh). Many of the data points showed that higher energy consumption was seen during colder temperatures, but we can further look into this by looking at levels of precipitation and dew point to see if there are any hidden relationships found. Ultimately, weather can be broadly defined and does not necessarily only refer to levels of precipitation and temperature only.
